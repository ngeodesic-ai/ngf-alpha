- **Defensive termination (standard Apache-2.0):** If you initiate patent litigation alleging that this software infringes your patent, your patent license from us under Apache-2.0 terminates.
- **This file is informational.** If anything here seems to conflict with the LICENSE file, the **LICENSE (Apache-2.0)** controls.

## Invention Families (scope overview)

**Family A — Stage 10: Geodesic Parser for Latent Trajectories**  
Deterministic parsing of primitives from latent trajectories using:
- whitening to reduced dimension,
- per-primitive energies \(E_{\parallel}, E_{\perp}\),
- **exclusive residual** (span-complement on z-scored \(E_{\perp}\)),
- matched filter + **dual thresholds** (relative vs. best channel + absolute null via circular shifts),
- ordering by \(t_k^{\star}\), concurrency edges, and primitive geodesic execution.

**Family B — Stage 11: Warp → Detect → Denoise**  
Stabilization of latent-space reasoning via:
- **Warp** to a single dominant well (funnel fit, core deepening, mild priors),
- **Detect** with residual energies, matched filtering, and **null-calibrated absolute gates**,
- **Denoise** using inhibition-like control guards (EMA+median, confidence gate, phantom-guard probes, MC jitter) and SNR logging.

> Families are prosecuted independently (distinct claim sets). Code in this repo may implement one or both.
