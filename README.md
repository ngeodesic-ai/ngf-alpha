# Noetic Geodesic Framework (Alpha)
ðŸš€ **Fresh out of the gate on August 15, 2025!** This is the Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF), a pioneering approach to boost GPT-2's reasoning with symbolic nudging. Achieved 100.0% accuracy on 100 ARC and 100 MMLU tasks when nudged, with a 65.0% stock baseline on an A100 GPU.

## Whatâ€™s This?
NGF enhances GPT-2 by adjusting its latent space using PCA and a symbolic nudge, tackling synthetic ARC patterns and MMLU challenges. Itâ€™s an alpha releaseâ€”early, exciting, and open for collaboration!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `transformers==4.30.0`
- `torch==2.4.1`
- `numpy==1.26.4`
- `scikit-learn==1.0.0`
- NVIDIA A100 GPU (e.g., Colab Pro+)

## Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
!pip install transformers==4.30.0 torch==2.4.1 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn==1.0.0

## Contribute
This is alpha software! Help us refine prompts, test on other hardware, or improve the nudge. **Contributors must sign the [CLA](CLA.md) and email it to ic3moor@gmail.com before submitting pull requests.**
