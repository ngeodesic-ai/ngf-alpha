# Noetic Geodesic Framework (Alpha)
üöÄ **This is the Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF)**, a pioneering approach to stabilize AI reasoning to address the hallucination problem via geodisics.

## What‚Äôs This?
NGF enhances GPT-2 by adjusting its latent space using PCA and a symbolic nudge, which is linear approximation to geodesics (see [technical draft](https://github.com/ngeodesic-ai/ngf-alpha/blob/main/docs/article_v9.pdf)), thus tackling synthetic ARC patterns and MMLU challenges. It‚Äôs an alpha release‚Äîearly, exciting, and open for collaboration!

## Research Plan Stages
The NGF follows a 12-step research plan, with 10 completed stages posted here. Step 10 is the public rollout with NVIDIA A100 results. Steps 11-12 (milestone reports) are in progress.

## Illustration: NGF Warped vs Flat Paths (Re: stage 5)

This animation shows how warped paths converge to correct answers in high-dimensional semantic space:

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `transformers==4.30.0`
- `torch==2.4.1`
- `numpy==1.26.4`
- `scikit-learn==1.0.0`
- NVIDIA A100 GPU (e.g., Colab Pro+)

## Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
!pip install transformers==4.30.0 torch==2.4.1 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn==1.0.0
```

Run latest benchmark:
```bash
python main-benchmark.py
```

#### Benchmark results - ARC test
```
Stock Accuracy: 65.0%
Warped Accuracy: 100.0%
Warped Semantic Similarity: 93.7%
Hallucination Rate: 0.0%
```

#### Self-Critiques
- Possible tuning bias that needs to be investigated
- 350 nudge steps per correction seems excessive
- Next step is to transition to larger sample of ARC tasks for validation (from datasets python package)
- The stock 67.0% and semantic similarity 94.1% are realistic

## Hardware Notes
Results validated on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (Colab Pro+ & Grok Expert). Testing on NVIDIA T4 and CPU currently inprogress. Performance may vary; A100 recommended for optimal results.
