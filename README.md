# Noetic Geodesic Framework (Alpha)
üöÄ **This is the Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF)**, a pioneering approach to boost GPT-2's reasoning with symbolic nudging. Achieved 100.0% accuracy on 100 ARC and 100 MMLU tasks when nudged, with a 65.0% stock baseline on an A100 GPU.

## What‚Äôs This?
NGF enhances GPT-2 by adjusting its latent space using PCA and a symbolic nudge, tackling synthetic ARC patterns and MMLU challenges. It‚Äôs an alpha release‚Äîearly, exciting, and open for collaboration!

## Research Plan Stages
The NGF follows a 10-step research plan, with 9 completed stages posted here. Step 9 is the public rollout with A100 results. Step 10 (milestone report) is in progress.
