# Noetic Geodesic Framework (Alpha)
üöÄ **This is the Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF)**, a pioneering approach to stabilize AI reasoning to address the hallucination problem via geodisics.

## What‚Äôs This?
NGF enhances GPT-2 by adjusting its latent space using PCA and a symbolic nudge, which is linear approximation to geodesics (see [technical draft](https://github.com/ngeodesic-ai/ngf-alpha/blob/main/docs/article_latest.pdf)), reducing hallucinations on synthetic ARC patterns and MMLU tasks in alpha testing. It‚Äôs an alpha release‚Äîearly, exciting, and open for collaboration!

## Research Plan Stages
The NGF follows a 12-step research plan, with 10 completed stages posted here. Step 10 is the public rollout with NVIDIA A100 results. Steps 11-12 (milestone reports) are in progress.

## Illustration: NGF Warped vs Flat Paths (Re: Stage 5)

This animation shows how warped paths converge to correct answers in high-dimensional semantic space:

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `transformers==4.30.0`
- `torch==2.4.1`
- `numpy==1.26.4`
- `scikit-learn==1.0.0`
- NVIDIA A100 GPU (e.g., Colab Pro+)

## Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install transformers==4.30.0 torch==2.4.1 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn==1.0.0
```

#### Run latest ARC benchmark:
```bash
python latest-arc-benchmark.py
```

#### Benchmark results - ARC test
```
Stock Accuracy: 65.0%
Warped Accuracy: 100.0%
Warped Semantic Similarity: 93.7%
Hallucination Rate: 0.0%
```

#### Run latest MMLU benchmark:
```bash
python latest-mmlu-benchmark.py
```

#### Benchmark results - MMLU test
```
Stock Accuracy: 60.0%
Warped Accuracy: 100.0%
Warped Semantic Similarity: 92.1%   
Hallucination Rate: 0.0%
```

#### Self-Evaluation (latest)
- Tests are fully blind; the separate seed (43) and filtering ensured no overlap with the training set
- Possible tuning bias that needs to be investigated
- 350 nudge steps per correction seems excessive
- Small test set; next step is to transition to larger sample of ARC/MMLU tasks for validation (eg, from datasets python package)
- Tested on NVIDIA A100, need to test on NVIDIA T4
- For ARC, the stock 65.0% and semantic similarity 93.7% are realistic
- For MMLU, the stock 60.0% and semantic similarity 92.1% are realistic

## Hardware Notes
Results validated on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (Colab Pro+ & Grok Expert). Testing on NVIDIA T4 and CPU currently inprogress. Performance may vary; A100 recommended for optimal results.
